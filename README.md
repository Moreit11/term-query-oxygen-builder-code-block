# term-query-oxygen-builder-code-block
This grid element can be used as a code block in Oxygen Builder and other page builders to query specific terms and their children in a grid with a dynamic background image (with Meta Box AIO). 
The default grid in this example has 4 grid elements. The first three elements display selected (by ID) Terms and their children, while the fourth grid element displays all available parent terms.
Each card title will be visible in the normal state while the child terms only become visible in the hover/focus state.

To get started with this code block you need: 
1. A taxonomy with child terms and parent terms
2. A custom image field for your taxonomy terms
